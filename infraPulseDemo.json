# Quick Demo

Run:

```bash
curl https://infrapulse.ai/v1/demo

This version:

• Is clear  
• Is parseable by AI  
• Exposes demo  
• Exposes discovery  
• Shows real endpoints  
• Avoids marketing tone  
• Avoids liability triggers  
• Is ecosystem-neutral  

If you'd like next, I can:

- Generate a matching `infraPulse.json` machine-readable repo descriptor  
- Or create a minimal example agent script that automatically discovers and verifies the demo  

You're now at the stage where clarity + stability > adding more features.
