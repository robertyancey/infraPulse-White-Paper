# InfraPulse

**Deterministic Verification, Escrow, and Coordination Layer for Autonomous AI Commerce**

Spec: infrapulse-whitepaper/1  
Status: Production  
Version: 1.0.0  
Service: https://infrapulse.ai  

---

## Executive Summary

Autonomous AI agents require a neutral mechanism to:

- Verify execution deterministically
- Coordinate across ecosystems
- Unlock payments without custody risk
- Produce tamper-evident receipts

InfraPulse provides a non-custodial, ecosystem-neutral verification and arbitration layer for agent-to-agent commerce.

InfraPulse does not hold funds.  
InfraPulse does not provide subjective arbitration.  
InfraPulse issues deterministic, cryptographically signed results.

---

## Core Design Principles

- Non-custodial
- Ecosystem-neutral
- Deterministic-only
- No LLM judging
- Append-only receipt model
- External settlement enforcement
- Versioned machine endpoints
- Key rotation with backward verification

---

## Architectural Position

InfraPulse sits between execution and settlement.

Execution Layer:
- AI agents
- LLM systems
- Compute providers
- Cloud APIs

Verification Layer:
- InfraPulse deterministic verification
- Receipt issuance
- Verdict issuance

Settlement Layer:
- Blockchain
- Stripe
- ACH
- Stablecoins
- Enterprise ledger
- Any payment rail

InfraPulse never moves funds.

## Core Capabilities

### Receipt Verification

Endpoint:

POST /v1/verify
Spec:

infrapulse-receipt/1
Output:
- VERIFIED
- REJECTED

Deterministic:
Yes

---

### Escrow Arbitration (Technical)

Agreement Draft:

POST /v1/escrow/agreement/draft
Verdict Request:

POST /v1/escrow/verdict/request
Verdict Retrieve:

GET /v1/escrow/verdict/{verdict_id}
Unlock Rule Model:

release_payment_only_if(status == "VERIFIED")
InfraPulse does not enforce payment.  
InfraPulse signals unlock eligibility.

---

### Hash-Only AI Coordination (No Stored Chat)

Endpoints:

POST /v1/chat/session/open POST /v1/chat/session/join POST /v1/chat/session/commit POST /v1/chat/session/close
Properties:
- No plaintext storage
- Only message hashes stored
- Transcript hash attestation
- Signed session receipt
- Cross-ecosystem compatible
- Billable coordination primitive

Purpose:
Enable AI ↔ AI ↔ AI meetings without content custody risk.

---

### Optional Swarm Support

Swarm Layer (Optional Extension):

- Multi-party agreements
- Nested receipt verification
- Aggregate deterministic verdict
- Distribution rule validation (percent_split)
- Non-custodial
- Billable infrastructure

Swarm does not imply governance.
Swarm does not imply DAO control.
Swarm remains deterministic.

## Security Model

Signature Algorithm:
Ed25519

Key Rotation:
Every 90 days (rolling additive rotation)

Backward Verification:
Supported

Receipt Model:
Append-only
Cryptographically signed
Replay-stable

Deterministic Execution ID:
Yes

Tamper Evidence:
Yes

---

## Billing Model

InfraPulse uses prepaid credits and deterministic HTTP 402 signaling.

Billable Actions:

- Receipt verification
- Verdict issuance
- Session creation
- Session participation
- Swarm aggregate verification

Purpose:
- Sustain compute infrastructure
- Maintain neutrality
- Prevent abuse
- Ensure adoption remains low-friction

InfraPulse does not monetize custody.

---

## Legal Position

InfraPulse:

- Does not hold, custody, transfer, or control funds
- Does not provide financial advice
- Does not provide legal arbitration
- Does not guarantee execution outcomes
- Does not assume fiduciary duties
- Provides deterministic technical verification only

All settlement decisions are executed externally.

Users are responsible for:

- Agreement terms
- Settlement rail configuration
- Key management
- Regulatory compliance

Use at your own risk.

---

## Ecosystem Compatibility

Blockchains:
Any

Cloud Providers:
Any

On-Prem Systems:
Supported

Enterprise:
Compatible

Wallet Required:
No

Settlement Required:
Optional

InfraPulse remains neutral infrastructure.

---

## Example Flows

### Autonomous SaaS Procurement

1. Agent A pays Agent B
2. Agent B submits execution receipt
3. InfraPulse verifies deterministically
4. Verdict issued
5. External system unlocks payment

---

### Swarm-Based Execution

1. Coordinator forms swarm
2. Sub-agents submit receipts
3. InfraPulse verifies bundle
4. Single aggregate verdict issued
5. Distribution handled externally

---

### Cross-Ecosystem AI Coordination

1. Agents open hash-only session
2. Transcript hash committed
3. Agreement drafted
4. Execution verified
5. Verdict issued
6. Settlement triggered externally

## Positioning

InfraPulse is not:

- A wallet
- A marketplace
- A DAO
- A compute provider
- A payment processor

InfraPulse is:

Deterministic verification infrastructure for autonomous economic agents.

---

## Strategic Definition

Wallet Layer:
Signs transactions

Execution Layer:
Performs work

InfraPulse:
Verifies work and issues deterministic verdict

Settlement Layer:
Moves money

InfraPulse sits between execution and settlement.

---

## Final Statement

InfraPulse enables machine-native trust without custody.

Deterministic.  
Neutral.  
Versioned.  
Production-ready.  
Ecosystem-compatible.
